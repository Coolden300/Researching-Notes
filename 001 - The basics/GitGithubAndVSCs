# Git and GitHub, Version Control Systems

This project is currently located on a GitHub hosted repository. For some this may be a familiar name, but for some not. For any developer it is crucial to know what are these, as they make teamwork and personal project extremely easy to share between team members and even personal devices. So here I will explain what are GitHub and Git and what is difference between them.

#### Version Control System(s) (VSC)
Git and GitHub are both Version Control Systems (VCS). What is a VCS you may ask? VSC is a tool that helps to manage versions of your project(s). We can take a videogame mechanic as a simple example: Before beating a boss in a video game you save your current progress. Then after beating the boss, you save your progress again after success, or load that one previous save to restore progress and try again with different method. That's how VSCs work. They help you to create versions of your projects and manage them. If you'd have and issue in your current version of the project, you can revert changes to previous version where everything is stable, or you upload a new version to save when everything is functioning after new code update.

Besides of controlling versions VSCs also register who have made certain changes in a project so that if somebody has any claims to certain changes they can see who they're gonna adress them to.

There is 2 types of VCSs: **centralized** and **distributed**
