As you might've noticed, I didn't do anything learning related yesterday, since I was cooking whole day, and didn't have any powers left to lean, so I just gamed until bed time. Today was quite an interesting day too, since I forgot to set my alarms...

Forgot to write a log so it's a bit later than it should be.
I've learned about distance sensor, the ultrasound one (forgot marking), and decided to strenghten my previous learnings by making some simple thing. And so I made a simple distance sensor with sound and light indicators! It was quite fun to make it, and now my knowledge is surely strenghtened.
Besides, I've learned how to use the sensor without libraries, but on raw input/output (using only electrical signals).
