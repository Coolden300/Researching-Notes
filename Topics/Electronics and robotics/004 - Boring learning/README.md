Why do I use markdown files with fuckton of folders to write down logs? Alright whatever, that's not what I came for today. It's "profile weeks" at our school at the moment. For 2 next weeks we will work on our group projects with students from other class, them being game design, to create a game prototype. It's kind of hard to be self-proclaimed team leader but things are going. Also I have math exam tomorrow so no more than 30 minutes on learning arduino today. I want to spare few hours on repeating material to be sure I'll get highest mark possible.

Edited log file from previous day since I forgot to add photos and videos. Nothing else for now.

I've learned about active buzzer. It's quite fun thing to work with, but not when my step father has an online lecture ongoing in nearby room. Hell, this thing is very loud. Don't think that I will learn about passive buzzers as next part, let's hop over...

Now I've learned about tilt switches. Isn't really reliable thing I'd say, but it is what it is. Also 30 minutes were done long ago, so it's time to wrap it up and start doing math.

Todays overall experience was boring to be honest.
