After finishing all my home business I decided to start working with Arduino that I've bought, actually It's cheaper version - Elegoo Uno. For the next month I am planning to spend most of self-development time on to learning more about Arduino and robotics and general.

Starting off, I've got an idea to try out: to make a pin-code for my old laptop that can be accessed with tablet key or a keycard. That should be simple. Time to research.

Holy shit, that was quite a lot of time... **wasted**. So how did it go:
- Get my Elegoo Uno kit
- Open ChatGPT
- Start asking and researching
- Attempt simple example code and scheme from a library
- Failure, some dumb ass error
- Retry with different approach
- Failure
- Repeat 2 previous actions for 2 hours straight
- Make a conclusion: the module I was working with is either malfunctioning or dead. I don't really know.
- Write to Elegoo customer support to request help/refund/replacement
- Get disappointed
- Remember that buzzer exists
- Get buzzer
- Make simple thing from their manual
- Get at least slightest joy from hearing something "alive" making noises...

Now I know how to add fake yet functional youtube links in my markdown files too. Well that's an improvement I guess.

Tomorrow I will probably need to actually read Elegoos documentation that I've downloaded about all the parts and libraries, and fix up navigation for this repository.

Haven't even finished my history assigment to do this garbage! 💢
