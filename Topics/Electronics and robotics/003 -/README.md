It is the first of the month!
Yes, you my dear reader may have noticed that yesterday I did't do anything. Guess spending whole day playing with my friends TF2 Classic was worth my time! Though late night stays and waking up in the middle of the day is not quite a good habit on weekends. Anyways, It's time to begin what I've promised to myself.

Need to take a bit of rest. Got quite overwhelmed after solving bunch of issues. Decided that standing up whole the time to connect Arduino to my PC will be pain in the ass, so I got my school laptom instead, installed Arduino IDE and Elegoo manual, which I had issues with as native Windows unzipper could not handle file names, so I first edited OS parameter for file length stuff, which didn't help, and installed our beloved WinRar. Besides, my wired headwhones are quite annoying to work with, as the cable stretches all over my workplace, which makes me thing that I should definitely buy PCI-E bluetooth and wi-fi module for my computer and switch to wireless headphones. Also having sort of stationary wi-fi data base would be cool, so that I didn't need to install files like this Elegoo documentation separately. Well all that's for future, my goal at this moment is to learn Arduino, not fix long term issues. I'll take a short rest and get back to studying.

After a ton of useless research i stopped with using VS Code just to simply edit files, without any other addons, and ARduino IDE separately to verify/upload sketches. Also I've completed first lesson from tutorial, which being LED and resistors lesson. Quite proud of myself!

Now on to doing next lessons. The next one is about RGB LEDs.

I have now learned how to work with analog ports and LED lights! Not professionally though. Also RGB LED flickers instead of lighting normally on mid frequencies. Guess it might be that it comes from China, lol.

Whoops, I forgot to write a log before going to eat. Well what I've learned now is how to work with these 4-pin buttons. I even made my own program that makes an LED light gradually increase brightness the longer you hold right button and turn off when you press left one.
